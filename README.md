# [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/tootsuite/mastodon-ansible.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/tootsuite/mastodon-ansible) Ansible playbook for installing Mastodon

This playbook contains several roles for provisioning a ready-to-go Mastodon instance.

## Prerequisites for running the playbook

- Python 2.x (>= 2.7.12)
- Virtualenv (>= 15.0.3)
- pip/python-pip (>= 8.x)

for testing purposes:

- Vagrant >= 1.9.3

## Setup

```sh
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the playbooks

### Bare

This playbook is intended to be run on a "bare" (virtual) server, with the support for provisioning the Mastodon stack as well as a PostgresSQL and Redis database.

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i <your-host-here>, -u <remote-user> --extra-vars="mastodon_db_password=your-password mastodon_host=example.com"
```

The playbook is using `become` for some of its tasks, hence the user you connect to the instance with will have to have access to sudo. It should ask you for the password in due time.

_Note: This assumes you're within the virtualenv already._

After you installed everything for the first time, you should run the mastodon setup wizard. This is only required once. After that the system
will can be automatically updated with rerunning the Ansible script.

To run the wizard, follow these steps:

```bash
ssh yourmachine
su - mastodon
cd ~/live
RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake mastodon:setup
```

After that start the mastodon services with:

```bash
systemctl start mastodon-*.service
```

#### Roles

By default, the playbook runs all of the roles defined here in sequence. You can skip any of them by specifying `--skip-tags=<role-name>`.

##### Example

Skipping the `postgres` role:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml --skip-tags=postgres -i <your-host>, -u <your-user>
```

#### web

This role contains the following tasks:

- `repositories.yml`: **Adds required package repositories** to pull in the latest software (e.g. yarn, nodejs)
- `packages.yml`: **Installs all the required packages** for Mastodon to run (see `vars/<distro>_vars.yml` for a list)
- `ruby.yml`: **Installs rbenv/ruby** globally so you can run Mastodon (it's a Ruby on Rails app)
- `user.yml`: **Adds a user to run Mastodon with** since you shouldn't be running Mastodon under a privileged account.

##### Settings

| config setting  | explanation |
|-----------------|-------------|
| mastodon_host   | The url where your mastodon instance is reachable. E.g. `example.social`
| disable_hsts    | Per default the system will enable [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security). You can set this to `true` if you want to disable it.

#### PostgresSQL

This role installs PostgresSQL, adds a database (named `mastodon_development` by default) and a user (named `mastodon` by default). For connecting to the database it can either use a local socket by setting the variable `mastodon_db_login_unix_socket` to the directory the Postgres socket lives in (`/var/run/postgresql` by default under Ubuntu 18.04) or a remote PostgreSQL instance you have installed somewhere else. You will than have to set the `mastodon_db_login_host` (IP address or hostname of database), `mastodon_db_port` (the port the database is accessible on; default `5432`), `mastodon_db_login_user` (the administrative user to connect to the database with) and `mastodon_db_login_password`.

##### Settings

| config setting  | explanation |
|-----------------|-------------|
| mastodon_db                   | The database name
| mastodon_db_user              | Database user for mastodon
| mastodon_db_password          | Database password for mastodon
| mastodon_db_login_unix_socket | Unix socket of the local PostgresSQL instance (not needed when using remote connection)

If you configure your PostgresSQL on another server, you need
to configure these settings additionally:

| config setting  | explanation
|-----------------|-------------|
| mastodon_db_login_host     | Host of the PostgresSQL
| mastodon_db_port           | Port of the PostgresSQL
| mastodon_db_login_user     | Admin user to connect with
| mastodon_db_login_password | Password of admin user


##### Examples

- Install PostgresSQL, create the database and user:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i <your-host-here>, -u <remote-user> --extra-vars="mastodon_db_password=your-password mastodon_db_login_unix_socket='/var/run/postgresql'"
```

- PostgreSQL installed on host `mastodob-db`, create the database and the user:

```sh
$ ansible-playbook playbook -i <your-host-here>, -u <remote-user> --extra-vars="mastodon_db_password=your-password mastodon_db_login_host=mastodon-db mastodon_db_port=5432 mastodon_db_login_user=your-admin-db-user mastodon_db_login_password=your-password"
```

#### redis

This role installs the [Redis](https://redis.io) key-value store, used by Mastodon, and its client libraries.

### Docker

FIXME

## Testing

Testing is done using [ServerSpec](https://www.serverspec.org). The tests are located in `spec/`. The tests are incorporating a [rubocop](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) run.

### CircleCI

This repository is regularly running tests using CircleCI. Its configuration can be found in `.circleci/config.yml`.

### Local testing

```sh
$ vagrant up bare|docker
```

This should provision a new instance within VirtualBox and run all the tests necessary to verify the Ansible playbook is valid. By default it runs the bare provisioning.

# TODO

- Add a firewall/sysctl role for hardening
- Add letsencrypt
- Add CentOS/RedHat/Amazon Linux support
- Add LB role
